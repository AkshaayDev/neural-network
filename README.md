## Overview

This is a minimal C++ library for **creating simple neural networks** from scratch.
Apart from standard C++ libraries, it does not have any external dependencies.
This project is experimental and for educational purposes.

> Disclaimer: Although the neural network library headers do not have any external dependencies, some of the examples in the `/examples` folder may have external dependencies (like raylib.h or stb_image.h)

- Minimal purpose-built `NNMatrix` matrix class
- Feed-forward networks with `NeuralNetwork` class

## Usage

### 1. Cloning and Including

Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/akshaaydev/neural-network.git
```

Then, include from the main neural network header `neural-network.hpp`.

```c++
#include "/neural-network/neural-network.hpp"
```

### 2. Creating and Configuring the Network

To create a network, define a `NeuralNetwork` object.

```c++
NeuralNetwork nn;
```

To set the network architecture, use the `addLayer()` function.

```c++
nn.addLayer<DenseLayer>(2, 2); // This sets a dense layer that takes in and outputs 2 neurons
nn.addLayer<ActivationLayer>(2, ActivationType::Sigmoid); // Applies sigmoid activation to the 2 neurons
```

To initialize the parameters of the network, use one of the functions from the `Initialization` namespace.

```c++
Initialization::xavierNormal(nn);
```

To set the loss function, use `setLossFunction()`.

```c++
// This sets the loss function to Mean Squared Error(MSE)
nn.setLossFunction(LossType::MSE);
```

### 3. Running the Network

To run the network, use `run()`.

```c++
// This does not set anything and returns the NNMatrix output of the network
NNMatrix predicted = nn.run(input);
```

To forward propagate an input and set relevant last inputs and outputs for each layer, use `forwardPropagation()`.

```c++
// This performs forward propagation with the input and returns the network output
NNMatrix input;
// Define `input` here
NNMatrix predicted = nn.forwardPropagation(input);
```

To set parameter gradients, use `backwardPropagation()`.

> Important: `forwardPropagation()` always has to be called to update activations before `backwardPropagation()`.
> However, propagation is handled by the network during training.

```c++
NNMatrix real;
// Define `real` here
nn.backwardPropagation(predicted, real);
```

### 4. Saving and Loading

To save network parameters and architecture, use the `save()` and `load()` functions.
To save the optimizer data, call `save()` with an `Optimizer*` pointer to the optimizer.
To load the optimizer data, call `load()` with a `std::unique_ptr<Optimizer>` pointer to the optimizer. If there is no optimizer data found in the input file stream, it will be ignored.

```c++
MomentumOptimizer mom(nn);
// Write the neural network data to a file `out.dat` with binary encoding
std::ofstream out("out.dat", std::ios::binary);
nn.save(out, &mom); // Save the network data to that file
out.close(); // Close the file
```

```c++
MomentumOptimizer mom(nn);
// Read the neural network data from a file `in.dat` with binary encoding
std::ifstream in("in.dat", std::ios::binary);
nn.load(in, std::make_unique<MomentumOptimizer>(mom)); // Load the network data from that file
in.close(); // Close the file
```

### 5. Training

Before training the network, an optimizer object must be created to specify the type and hyperparameters of optimization. The optimizer type can be any derived class of the `Optimizer` class.

```c++
GradientDescentOptimizer gd(nn) // Attaches a network to `gd` with default parameters
GradientDescentOptimizer gd(nn, 15) // Attaches a network to `gd` with learning rate 15
```

The optimizer constructor must include the network object and optionally the hyperparameters(See Optimizer features for their hyperparameters).

To train the network, a trainer object must be created and initialized with the network, optimizer and batch.
The batch is a `std::vector` of samples which is a `std::pair` of the input and output `NNMatrix`.

```c++
std::vector<std::pair<NNMatrix, NNMatrix>> batch;
// Example sample that maps {{0},{0}} to {{0}}
batch.push_back(std::make_pair(NNMatrix::fromVector({0,0}), NNMatrix::fromScalar(0.0))); // 0 ^ 0 = 0

Trainer trainer(nn, gd, batch);
```

> Note: The network and batch in the constructor are passed by reference.
> If batch shuffling is enabled, it will modify the original batch too.
> To prevent this, you can copy the batch into a new variable or disable shuffling (See below).

Callbacks for iterations and epochs can be set like this:

```c++
trainer.iterationCallback = []() { std::cout << "Iteration " << nn.iterationsTrained << "\n"; };
trainer.epochCallback = []() { std::cout << "Epoch " << nn.epochsTrained << "\n"; };
```

The batch is divided into samples to update parameters based on each sample's derivatives.
The sample size is `-1` by default, meaning the whole batch is trained in an iteration.
By default, the batch is shuffled before before every epoch but this can be disabled.

```c++
trainer.sampleSize = 128;
trainer.enableShuffling = false;
```

Finally call the `train()` method with the number of epochs.

```c++
trainer.train(100);
```
